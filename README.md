# Development

The service is an express server with graphql meaning that we also can have REST endpoints.

## Files to consider while developing

- `src/resolvers.ts`
  - In this file we declare our resolvers
  - Where the magic happens üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- `src/schema.graphql`
  - Here you can find the graphql schema
- `src/types.ts`
  - All types are declared here.
- `codegen.yml`
  - In this file we find the config in regards to the autogenerated types that you can find here: `src/generated-types/resolversTypes.ts`
  - **Important note** in the `codegen.yml` we have something called mappers that specify the relationship between Typescript types and the graphql schema.

## How to run it locally

```sh
# Generate resolver types
npm run generate
# Will generate resolver types and run application with nodemon
npm run dev
```

The server is listening to port 8080.

You can find the graphql playground at: http://localhost:8080/graphql
